Functions are useful to prevent repeating code - DRY
Good practises:
    - One function should do one thing (makes it easier to unit test)
    - Clear naming makes it easier to understand
    - Naming convention: lowercase and underscores for spaces
    - Not having too many arguments in a function
    - Arguments should be clear of their need, include type hints
    - Return statements if used by another piece of code
    - Avoid functions that print 
    - For function default parameters, they should go at the end
        e.g: greeting(name, age), if name has a default parameter, age has to have a default paramerter!
            (alternatively, switch the order of the parameters)
    - when calling a function, you can call the paramerter name to make it clearer
        e.g: greeting(name='bob', age=35)
